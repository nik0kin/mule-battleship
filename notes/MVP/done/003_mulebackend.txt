X- webpack backend to node-readable module for mule backend to consume
X- setup backend 'prod' build (uglifed and saved in dist/)
X- setup frontend 'prod' build (uglifed and saved in dist/)
X- dont hardcode first player as 'p1'

  X- mule.tgp.io (domains)
   X- ssl

      - watch/rebuild battleship
   X- nginx
   X- mule server
    X- uses zion.tgp.io for db

 - Mule Backend doesnt catch bad id and doesnt send 404
  - example: http://localhost:313/webservices/games/5b048b2daebfc56553f52d77/history/888
 - Mule SDK doesnt reject promise if its 400


 - does Mule Backend catch it if a player players out of Turn
   - I saw validateTurn reject a Turn but I expected it to reject because of the wrong player is submitting a Tur
