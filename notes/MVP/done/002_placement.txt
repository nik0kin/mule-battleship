 - only genericsize amount of ships, not ship structures (for mvp)

shared:

DEFAULT_SETUP = {
 battleship: 1,
 etc
}

frontend:
 Action:
  {
    type: PlaceShips
    params: {
     shipPlacements: [
       { shipId: 4, coord: 4,6 }
       etc
     ]
    }
  }

 UI:
  title followed by ship structure grid

  "Click the ship on the left, then click a spot on your grid, click again to rotate"

  table cell turns red if intersection

  X- shiplistship border turns dotted to indicate being placed

  1a. Click occupied grid cell to rotate ship

  2. Click grid cell
   - unable to click an occupied spot
    - not needed for MVP
  X- shiplistship border turns solid to indicate it has been placed
  X- shiplistship border turns solid red to indicate collision

  3. repeat til all ships are placed

  4. click button to send Turn

  redux:
   actions:
    SELECT_SHIPLIST_SHIP
     X- set selectedShipBeingPlaced

    modify CLICK_SQUARE
     (when placing)
     X- to add actions ShipPlacement
     X- unset selectedShipBeingPlaced
     X- look for collisions
     (when not placing)
     X- rotate ship, and update ShipPlacement

backend:
 validate Action:
  each shipPlacement {
    is ship id valid?
    does ship belong to currentPlayer?
    are coords valid?
    are coords already occupied?
  }

 do Action:
  each shipPlacement {
    ship.coords = shipPlacement.coords
  }

 validateTurn:
   only allow one action
