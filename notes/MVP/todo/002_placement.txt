    modify CLICK_SQUARE
     (when placing)
     X- to add actions ShipPlacement
     X- unset selectedShipBeingPlaced
     X- look for collisions
     (when not placing)
     X- rotate ship, and update ShipPlacement

backend:

  each shipPlacement {
    is ship id valid?
    does ship belong to currentPlayer?

  each shipPlacement {
    ship.coords = shipPlacement.coords
  }
